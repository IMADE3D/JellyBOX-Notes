# Heated Bed Quick Start

Congratulations. You have just acquired a powerful weapon to help you with **your war on warp**: the JellyBOX heated bed upgrade. This short document will help you get the most out of it.

## Guidelines
- Your heated bed is limited to **80C**, and for most materials under most conditions, you won't need to go above **55C**. High enough a temperature to print a wide range of materials with little warp, but low enough to prevent burns, and keep the JellyBOX friendly.
- You can use heated bed with any material and any print surface (/treatment), but some combinations are better than others.
- **PETG**.
  - PETG on hot blue tape works well.
  - Start at 55C and see.
  - Make sure to keep your blue tape clean - do not touch it with human fingers that are naturally greasy.
  - To increase the blue tape's _bite_, lightly buff it with fine grit sandpaper (300-600). It can make a huge difference.
- **PLA**.
  - _PLA does not usually require heated bed_ when used with blue tape. Don't get me wrong, heated bed still reduces warp, but PLA often warps so little (even when using just plain blue tape), that the additional time spent on heating the bed is not worth it for many users.
  - However, in colder environments, you can use the heated bed to get to pleasant 25C.
- (Nylon.)
  - Experimental. Usable with PVA based glue stick, but we need more experiments to determine the best settings.
- (ABS.)
  - We do not officially support ABS. When ABS melts, it produces fumes that seem to harmful to humans. The research is still not conclusive, but we err on the side of caution. The good news is there are many materials today that are superior to ABS mechanically, and are easier to print. Use PETG instead! If you really want to, you will be able to print ABS on the JellyBOX, but... you'll have to figure that out.

  ## Cold Environment
  - Try increasing the bed temperature. That usually helps. Even 80C for PETG if you have to.
  - In cold environments, warp is worse as the temperature gradient is bigger. (Cold environment is anything below 21C, but we have had printers in rooms as cold as 10C.)
  - Try to enclose the printer to decrease cold air flow. Old wardrobes work great!
